## ðŸš€ Installing pybamm-param

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

The module dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`, the dependancies which are non optional which are installed with the package.

The optional dependancies are split into `dev` and `docs`. `dev` are used for testing and linting, `docs` are used for building the sphinx documentation.

    virtualenv --python="<path to python 3.11>" env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

3. Install packages into the virtual environment

    ```bash
    pip install -e ./[dev,docs]
    ```

### Windows

1. Create a virtual environment (this is strongly recommended to avoid clashes with the dependencies)

    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running
